        “You must build on the resources represented by our young professionals and by our nation’s farmers. Without their involvement, we cannot succeed. With their involvement, we cannot fail.’’</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
A.P. J Abdul Kalam has immortalized these words in his book “Ignited Minds”. From childhood, I have been encouraged by my family to be curious about the world we live in. I have always taken a keen interest in novel science experiments and have participated in numerous Science Exhibitions. When I began reading into energy conservation, I conceptualized and executed an entire project on a miniature model of a magnetic train. My project received the Second Place in a Statewide competition. This fueled my desire to learn more and do better in the sciences. I attended an inspiring lecture during a Techfest at IIT-Bombay conducted by Dr. Bala Bhardwaj (Managing Director of Boeing Research & Technologies, India). The lecture discussed India’s inability to cope with the global standard of Aerospace and Mechanical engineering, which forces us to rely on other countries. The thoughts shared during that lecture prompted me to investigate Mechanical Engineering and understand the professional scope of this field. I was enthralled by the subject matter. My interest in this niche field of engineering has guided all my academic decisions to date. I aspire to become a leading Mechanical Engineer who can actively contribute to my country’s development in this sector.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I concluded that I will need to start with a degree in Mechanical Engineering to cement a strong foundation in the applicability of physics and mathematics. I was eager to begin my academic journey as soon as possible and hence opted for a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering at the Government Polytechnic right after my 10th grade followed by bachelors degree in ME from University of Mumbai. My technical knowledge all compounded to give me a strong overview of the field of mechanical engineering.

I have worked on two internships. The first was at Nitin Industries, where I learned how the injection and blow molding processes take place. I also learned various factors governing the blow molding of a plastic bottle such as pressure requirements, gravity roles, and temperature requirements. I got a chance to work at the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport which is the chief provider of all the public transport in Mumbai. Here I was introduced to the meticulous interaction between various departments like the store, management, worker level, and maintenance. I performed the overhauling of various components to diagnose problems. My vast practical experience enabled me to publish 6 research papers. My topics range from design reviews to performance analysis to cost reduction. 
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
This professional experience taught me how to amalgamate my academic knowledge and practical training into a usable solution for real-world problems, and helped me develop strong communication, interpersonal skills, teamwork, and project management skills that I know are critical to the success of any team.
